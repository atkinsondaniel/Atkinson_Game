This game is a bullet hell type dodging game.
When started, the player is prompted to choose a color for their ship.
Then, bullets start flying. 
The green bullets fly in straight line.
Yellow bullets are ejected in a circle from the enemy spaceship.
Pink bullets travel in a wave pattern and are shot out between 225 and 315 degrees.
Blue bullets are shot in an expanding spiraling circle.
The game runs at different speeds on different computers, running about half as slow on school machines comparted to my home computer.
I have yet to beat my game at home, but have beat it at school.
